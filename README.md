## Notes

**_The more users you have to check, more time it will take_**

**_The latest version of the script runs both on chromium and firefox based browsers_**

## DEV

Node version: 16.14.0 (If using nvm use the comand "nvm use")
When introducing new changes to `main.tsx`, make sure to run the "build" command in-order to automatically format, compress, and convert your code. (In the future will be automatic).
